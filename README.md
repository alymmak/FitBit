# Fit Bit Project
Developed a simplified version of the activity tracking device, Fitbit, on an FPGA. The Fitbit program implemented a subset of features offered by the real Fitbit device and app.

The inputs to the Fitbit module are:
1. A sequence of pulses denoting steps
2. The system clock and reset
